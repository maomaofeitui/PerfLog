10/11/2012 - Version 1.2.4
	* Changed property file loading to merge the overriding properties file with
	  default property file included in PerfLog.jar and PerfLogAppLogger.jar. 
	  Previous version would load only either of the files which requires the
	  overriding property file to include all necessary property files from the
	  default property file. This change enables the overriding property files i.e
	  perfLog.properties, runtimeEnv.properties and perfLogAppLogger.properties to
	  specify only the properties that is different from the default.
	  Sample properties file with the default values are provided in the distribution
	  in properties folder
	

10/09/2012 - Version 1.2.3
	* Refactored Struts and Portlet Filters. Current Struts filter will
	  work only with WebSphere Portal.
	* Portlet Filter will work with any JSR-286 portlet container
	* Getting Portlet Name and Page Name has been abstracted out as
	  it is vendor dependent.
