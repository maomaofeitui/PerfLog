# Sample txnThresholdOverride.properties file when using PerfLog
# 
# Include this file (named txnThresholdOverride.properties) 
# in the application class path for applications that
# wish to override the default response time threshold 
# for specific transactions that is known to take more than the 
# default response time threshold is set in perfLog.properties
#
# Response time threshold value is used to decide if
# the PerfLog context data needs to be dumped when deleting the context
# The PerfLog context data dump can be useful to debug performance problems
# However if there are known transaction that takes more than the default
# response time threshold (typically 4000 milliseconds) then this file
# can be used to override this threshold for those transactions.
#

#
# This file provides a list of 
# transaction names  or  sub transaction names
# with response time threshold that will override 
# the global response time threshold

#The format of the properties are
# 
# <txn name or sub txn name>=<response time threshold in milli seconds>
#
#To find transaction names and sub transaction name 
#check the PerfLog context data dump from application logs for string txnList
#For portlet transactions - 
#     transaction names = page name, portlet name 
#For servlet transactions -
#     transaction names = servlet URI, query string
#For Struts transactions -
#    transaction names = action servlet, action mapping name, action mapping type, action form, action 
#For Web Services transactions - 
#    transaction names = end point URL, operation name
#
#The check would succeed even if there is a partial match to txn name
#e.g instead of specifying the complete txn name, a part string can also
#be provided assuming it is unique enough to identify that transaction
#If the transaction name has a space, escape it with a back slash.
#Wild card character * is not allowed
#
#
#Example transaction name and response time threshold specification
#
#Set the response time threshold to 8 seconds for transactions that contains string
#Appointment Search
Appointment\ Search=8000
#An example of transaction name that matches a web service name string
ComplaintsService=10000
